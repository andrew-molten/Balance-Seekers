# Balance Seekers

Hey there! This is the first app that I ever built!

I had just learnt about the MVC framework so tried my hand at building this with it using just JS, HTML & CSS.

## The Challenge

I have so many hobbies, sports, wellbeing practices that I enjoy, keep my well rounded & make me feel good.

The challenge is that during a busy life it's so much easier to just chuck on running shoes and get out the door, than to remember to go setup a slackline, go rock climbing, do some yoga, get to the hot pools etc.

## How it works

So with balance seekers you can make your categories: exercise, wellbeing, creative. Then add activities to your category, when you log a session for any activity, that activity will go to the bottom of the list, so that the things you've been neglecting are always hovering around the top of the list.

You can also add variations e.g. for running you might add: long flat, short flat, long hill, short hill. These will also rotate with each session logged.

This was before I had learnt about databases, so it's currently just storing the data in localStorage.

## Additional features

I would love to improve the design of this app, as it clearly isn't too pretty.

## Lessons learnt

Although I did stick to the MVC framework, I have realised that within MVC I could still have componentised everything better, unfortunately my controller is one long messy file controlling the whole app.

Building on that point, having a clean file structure and well named functions is super important so that you can understand what's going on when you want to add things in the future. Or even when you are still involved in the initial build, once files start getting really long, it becomes increasingly difficult to navigate the code base.

Build refactoring into the development process.

LocalStorage was a great short term solution, but a terrible user experience when your browser clears the cache.

## Final thoughts

I still have a need for this app in my life and loads more feature ideas.

I think this was a good protoype and a great first project to learn how to break problems down, and find solutions.

However I think that this is quite a messy project, and would like to rebuild this using a modern web framework with more reliable data solutions.

I'm also thinking that it is more of a mobile solution, so I'm likely to use React Native or Flutter after I do some research into which would be more appropriate, or which one I'm more interested in learning.
